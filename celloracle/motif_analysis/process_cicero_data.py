"""
This file contains custom functions for the analysis of ATAC-seq data.
Genomic activity information (peak of ATAC-seq) will be extracted first.
Then the peak DNA sequence will be subjected to TF motif scan.
Finally we will get list of TFs that potentially binds to a specific gene.

Codes were written by Kenji Kamimoto.
